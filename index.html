            &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray </em> &nbsp; is an 1891
            philosophical novel by Irish writer and playwright Oscar Wilde.
            First published as a serial story in the July 1890 issue of
            Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, the editors feared the story was
            indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted five hundred words
            before publication. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian
            Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers,
            some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating
            the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde
            aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the
            British press. Wilde revised and expanded the magazine edition of
            The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) for publication as a novel; the
            book edition (1891) featured an aphoristic preface â€” an apologia
            about the art of the novel and the reader. The content, style, and
            presentation of the preface made it famous in its own literary
            right, as social and cultural criticism. In April 1891, the
            editorial house Ward, Lock and Company published the revised version
            of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

              <p>
                &nbsp; <strong><em>Oscar Wilde</em> </strong>&nbsp; was born on
                October 16, 1854, to the Irish nationalist and writer Speranza
                Wilde and the doctor William Wilde. After graduating from Oxford
                in 1878, Wilde moved to London, where he became notorious for
                his sharp wit and flamboyant style of dress. Though he was
                publishing plays and poems throughout the 1880s, it wasn t until
                the late 1880s and early 1890s that his work started to be
                received positively. In 1895, Oscar Wilde was tried for
                homosexuality and was convicted and sentenced to two years in
                prison. Tragically, this downfall came at the height of his
                career, as his plays, An Ideal Husband "and The Importance of
                Being Earnest, "were playing to full houses in London. He was
                greatly weakened by the privations of prison life, and moved to
                Paris after his sentence. Wilde died in a hotel room, either of
                syphilis or complications from ear surgery, in Paris, on
                November 30, 1900.

              <h6>Wilde is 'different'....</h6>
              <p>
                &nbsp; This is one of the most 'different' books that I have
                read, that dwells a lot on privileges of the upper class using
                Oscar Wilde's 'libertarian' approach to life. It took me a few
                chapters to get into Wild's 'dense' writing style. Nothing is
                cut and dried and Wilde takes any ideas, philosophies, outlooks
                on life about three degrees farther than anybody else I've read.
                It's a good exercise in looking at things differently with a
                fresh outlook. But being Oscar Wilde EVERYTHING is carried to
                the max. If everybody had Wilde's eloquence, intellect and wit,
                I doubt that anything would ever get done in the 'real' world.
                Excellent read though, and a good lesson on how NOT to spend
                your life, whatever your station.

              <h6>The picture of Dorian Gray</h6>
              <p>
                &nbsp; Lengthy conversations form the majority of this tale,
                which is an early urban fantasy. <br />
                A young dandy called Dorian Grey enjoys society in London and
                has his portrait painted, but a lot of the artist goes into the
                work. Grey is influenced by an older man who thinks women are
                trivial decorative creatures and only youth and beauty matter.
                Grey becomes absorbed by such ideas and makes a pact that his
                portrait should grow older instead of him. Meanwhile he manages
                to fall for a penniless young actress and changes his mind. But
                the portrait starts to reflect his growing selfishness and
                cruelty, then as Grey discards the girl, preferring to collect
                obscure art, it ages instead of him in the attic where he has
                hidden the revealing work. <br />
                The reflections of society are interesting, and we can clearly
                see what Wilde was not able to say, that some men are more
                attracted to beautiful young men than they are to women. The
                threat of revelation was enough to force a man to a dreadful
                deed. We also see that women have intellect by following a few
                conversations with them. Family loyalty is important to those
                who have a close family and the rich of the day think hardly at
                all of the poor or servants. I enjoyed the mounting tensions and
                seeing Wilde's famous lines in context. "The only thing worse
                than being talked about is not being talked about," is one. We
                see a good portrait of London and some country life. To me the
                book reads as unbalanced by having a long drawn out slow start
                with individuals speaking for ten minutes each, whereas the end
                is active, decisive and hurried. This is why I am not giving it
                a higher rating. But I am glad I've read it.

              <h6>Be careful what you wish for</h6>
              <p>
                &nbsp; <strong> THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY</strong> is the
                epitome of "be careful what you wish for". Drawing on themes of
                culpability, hedonism and moral parsimony, it's not difficult to
                see why Wilde's story of a young dandy who gets everything he
                desires has become a classic. This version is the "cleaned up"
                one, but it still retains its homoerotic edge. In this
                plot-driven age, the structure of the novel seems a little top
                heavy and the ending rushed, plus there's far, far too much
                dialogue. By modern standards, there doesn't "feel" like
                "enough" story to justify an entire novel - if written today, I
                would wager it would be a short story with a sting in the tale.
                That said, it's a masterpiece in terms of characterisation and
                Wilde's witticisms and ripostes are glorious. It's also an easy
                read for young people, who would understand this cautionary tale
                about the excesses of youth (in comparison to say, the
                difficulties and delights of marriage, as in Austen's work).
                Recommended.
